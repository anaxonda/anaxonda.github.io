Arriving at the coast I am greeted by a man named Yiyo and his wife. They are collecting chorros (mussels) and fishing, having been married just a few days before.

It turns out they run a [famous](https://www.eater.com/2018/6/6/17417350/best-seafood-baja-mexico-mariscos-yiyos) [seafood restaurant](https://facebook.com/mariscosyiyosoficial) in Ensanada. Soon I am being plied with beer and amazing feast of chorros and tacos de camarones. All cooked on offcuts from the fender guitar factory in Ensanada. Yiyo takes me fishing, scrambling over cliffs trying to avoid pacific swells crashing in, casting out for lingcod. Dolphins and sea lions swim by. Quite a nice day.

When I tried to grab it to free it started to sink its talon into my palm, and that's when I realized it was very alive. There I was, alone im the desert, locked in a silent struggle with this owl who was trying its very best to lacerate my hand wide open. 
Finally I was free with just a little blood, alas the owl could not say the same, its wing was ripped open and quite caught.

I was kind of just meandering on roads that weren't on my map. Was in a paddock with a massive bull that was quite angry. Had to drop my bike over a barbed wire fence to escape.

I rode all day by the sea to get to Vicente Guererro. Later I noticed a nice wide beach to ride on below some cliffs. Well after some time riding it was not so wide, and the tide kept rising. Soon I was dragging my bike over slippery rocks with waves lapping the wheels. So that was fun.

This coast is filled with people picking rocks all day into large bags that are shipped to the US. So now you know where your landscaping rocks come from.

N of the bridge in Vicente Guererro Motel Ortiz is 300 MXN for single room, across from the amazing Lonchería Elena. Any cyclist needing help should contact Salvador from FASS bike shop. 

Multiple people told me of shady undergoings near Eréndira. Chinese human trafficking on the beaches. [There is an interesting connection between Mexican and Chinese crime syndicates](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/dragon-on-the-border-mexican-and-chinese-transnational-criminal-networks-and-implications-f).
