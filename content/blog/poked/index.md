Abalones, longosta. Here they are both sold almost exclusively to Chinese buyers. The abalone are harvested by a man in a wetsuit, breathing from a hose going to the surface.

In the horizon, an apparition in the desert, a sleek spaceship overlander RV. Such a machine must be filled with refrigerators and glistening cold cervezas. A prayer to the cerveza gods and behold, the spaceship stops, the glistening cervezas are foisted to the pious.

In the night a coyote comes and steals a bottle. Apparently they learned how to open water bottles.

In the mountains, a Misión named San Borja. A woman warned us the señor here is un poco loco.

 A wild looking man with a machete and an icepicl on the end of a shepards crook or cardon stick. He said he hates Americans as they steal indian artifacts. The springs and termales this place is known for 'invented stories by tourists'. He says we should leave and ride all night under the full moon. A strange passive aggressive encounter. We go and make a big fire a bit down the road.

Later we learn this man is known to be a bit off the rocker. He once stabbed a tourist's dog to death because it was barking at him. And apparently he likes to give people brackish water and harrass women.
