San Diego, a city of noisy concrete freeways and some nice people. After some days of rain the sun shone so I embarked south.

In chula vista I met a guy Steve who had a car hit his tandem bike in Florida, he spent months in the hospital and still couldn't walk much. And then after the accident somebody stole the bike.


Camped in peak above otay in the dark above thle lights of Tijuana. The bike felt very heavy carrying 8 L of water up 1000m climb. Someone said it was an active shooting range, and next morning I heard heavy gunfire, some friendly people having a good time with their war machines.

In Tecate, cars jostling, but no freeways, a slow jostling that you can ride a bici in. A scent of birria and someone burning some garbage. A nice plaza to sit in the sun with some friends and watch the world revolve.
