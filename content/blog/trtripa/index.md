In Vicente Guererro I only briefly enjoyed a tripe taco. Several hours after I ate it it wanted to escape my belly. Luckily thete was an old coffee can by my tent, as it took several hours for that taco to finally escape.

Camped above Nueva Odisea someone came by with search lights in the night pointed at our tents, but when they heard a gringo accent they laughed and drove off.

An amazing descent into cataviña to resupply meant a brutal climb back to the route to the coast, with 13 kg of water and 5 days of food. Luckily we met about 20% of San Jose del Faro's (coast village we were going to) 30 inhabitants there in cataviña getting cervezas and gasolina. I have never seen a more worn tire than what they had on the rear of there truck, worn deep into the wire.
They whisked us in the back of the pickup back up the climb to the entrada to the coast. One of them promised that the next night we would feast at his house.
