Tecate had some cool rocks, looked like catavi√±a further South.

I made a very bold decision and sent my stove ahead to a warmshowers host in La Paz, as I had heard the thing to do was grill on the fire every night. So armed with an old toaster oven rack and  some beans and tortillas I set off.

First night en ruta it already paid off with quesadillas and roasted peppers...

Two guys in a pickup stopped me and asked if I had seen any militares. I'm sure they were up to great things.

Uruapan.

I guzzled some water and found the local termales. An offer to stay on the grass there was soon eclipsed by a a local rancher, Jaime who had a spare bed in his barn. He wished for me to extend this offer to any cyclist, so if you are in Uruapan just ask at the termales for the rancho de Jaime. 

At Uruapan they had private baths with a continuous stream of water piped in. Just the thing for my beat up legs after wading through fields of cactus looking for a place to sleep.
