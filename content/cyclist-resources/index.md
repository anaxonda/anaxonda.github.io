Some useful resources and links for cycle touring.

## Hospitality networks

- [trustroots.org]() - slowly gaining traction
- [https://welcometomygarden.org/]() -slow travellers
- [warmshowers.org]() the old main cycling network, see below
- [couchsurfing.com]() -see below
- [Heberge un Cyclo Voyageur](https://facebook.com/groups/555958764898796)
- casa de ciclistas (see section)

The main hospex (hospitality exchange) networks of the past, couchsurfing and warmshowers, have sadly fallen under more and more corporate sway that is not nessecarily aligned with the interests of the people in them. The great communities they fostered in the past have suffered as a result. Couchsurfing does not even allow viewing old accounts without paying. Warmshowers, community and volunteer built since 1993 now has a corporate board since 2015 after the founder's retirement. This board has been siphoning donations to tech firms that have failed to improve the service, disabled the community built app, and censored discussion about warmshowers future. See [warmshowers.bike](warmshowers.bike). 

There is a new effort to create a [federated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_social_network) protocol to connect hosting exhange communities, and avoid having data trapped in one network. See their main webpage for their aims and philosophies: [http://openhospitality.network/](http://openhospitality.network/).

## Casa de Ciclistas

Mainly a latin american institution. People opening their houses or gardens for ciclaviajeros.  This webpage from 2010 lists many, unknown if the hosts are still active: [https://mebobandsurly.wordpress.com/2010/03/28/casa-de-ciclistas-in-latin-america/]()
Below is certainly an incomplete list, if you know of one please say so.
