Hello to all my diehart fans (my mother). I'm happy to report that Kai is still alive for now (against many odds). Don't hold your breath but its possile this blog could expand in the coming decades. For now I leave you with a baby llama I had the pleasure of meeting recently. An unpleasant creature that tried to attack me multiple times, and chased me out of the village
