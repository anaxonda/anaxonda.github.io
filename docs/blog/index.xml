      <description>In Chicago I rode an airport bus on a suprisingly long journey, on that road system in the city within the city that is O&amp;rsquo;hare. Trash was blowing in the grey wind, but not homeless people. It was just me and two caffeinated and nicotein-ed flight attendents, on their endless journey around the world in metal tubes. At the gate there was a babel of yiddish, the anguish of young children, and other unknown exotic noises.</description>

      <description>Coming out of the mountains. Very steep. Roads along the coast plunge straight into the sea. Running out of food, but when try to buy, fisherman just give us tacos and rum. It is difficult to make many km when people constantly ply you with tacos.&#xA;Many drunk people must have died here.&#xA;mysterious Jesus cave. Although we were there on easter unfortunately there was no ressurections&#xA;Huge canyons in the Sierra de Gigante.</description>

      <description>Time blurs, dates become meaningless. Days become puncated by invitations for tacos, beers, cafes, building fires morning and night. If lucky there is sometimes a fog, called a &amp;ldquo;brisa&amp;rdquo; (in other parts brisa means breeze, so it can be confusing) . But usually there is only that short wonderful period when the sun has not creeped over the hill again, that you are not roasting by the sun. A nice time in the tropics, when the birds come alive, a goat bellows in the distance, and the air is so cool.</description>

      <description>One morning I saw a guy picking up garbage in the middle of nada. That&amp;rsquo;s not something you see everyday in Mexico. He was a troquero, owned a trucking business with his brother. They ran out of hydraulic fluid so his brother had to drive to the nearest town to find some. He was picking up botes (cans) to redeem for scrap while he waited. Luckily there was no shortage as the most popular pastime is downing tecates and throwing the bote out the window.</description>

      <description>In Bahía, a California weed farmer who&amp;rsquo;s mothers&amp;rsquo; family was from my hometown, and two brothers of someone I went to high school with, also from my hometown. Seemingly crazy odds like this seem to happen quite often.&#xA;Stories about cartels, corrupt police. Neighbors dissapearing in the night. Drug running accross the Sea of Cortez from Sinaloa. They have a saying, &amp;ldquo;No abre la bica o entran las moscas&amp;rdquo; (Don&amp;rsquo;t open your mouth or the flies will come in).</description>

      <description>Abalones, longosta. Here they are both sold almost exclusively to Chinese buyers. The abalone are harvested by a man in a wetsuit, breathing from a hose going to the surface.&#xA;fried abalones&#xA;dried lobster, if only I had unlimited supply&#xA;Omar and Tere feed us, put us up in a shack, tellmany stories of the world passing by the village of just a few families.

      <description>In Vicente Guererro I only briefly enjoyed a tripe taco. Several hours after I ate it it wanted to escape my belly. Luckily thete was an old coffee can by my tent, as it took several hours for that taco to finally escape.&#xA;this tumbleweed could take out a cyclist&#xA;Beautiful estuary&#xA;Marie, owner of Super Torta la Unica and her son Ramses, who rented us a room for a few nights</description>

      <description>Arriving at the coast I am greeted by a man named Yiyo and his wife. They are collecting chorros (mussels) and fishing, having been married just a few days before.&#xA;It turns out they run a famous seafood restaurant in Ensanada. Soon I am being plied with beer and amazing feast of chorros and tacos de camarones. All cooked on offcuts from the fender guitar factory in Ensanada. Yiyo takes me fishing, scrambling over cliffs trying to avoid pacific swells crashing in, casting out for lingcod.</description>

      <description>Tecate had some cool rocks, looked like cataviña further South.&#xA;nice trails leaving tecate&#xA;I made a very bold decision and sent my stove ahead to a warmshowers host in La Paz, as I had heard the thing to do was grill on the fire every night. So armed with an old toaster oven rack and some beans and tortillas I set off.&#xA;First night en ruta it already paid off with quesadillas and roasted peppers&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>San Diego, a city of noisy concrete freeways and some nice people. After some days of rain the sun shone so I embarked south.&#xA;along the san diego river&#xA;In chula vista I met a guy Steve who had a car hit his tandem bike in Florida, he spent months in the hospital and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk much. And then after the accident somebody stole the bike.&#xA;Camped in peak above otay in the dark above thle lights of Tijuana.</description>

      <title>Fox Fit Damper Oil Change</title>

      <description>After five years or so the fit4 cartridge damper in my 2017 fox34 (id C8sb) was quite sluggish. This is to be expected as the bladder ingests oil over time.&#xA;The damper cartridge is easy to remove with a socket or just a large adjustable wrench. The tricky part is removing the valve at the top in order to drain the old oil and refill. I was following the official fox fit4 damper guide.</description>

      <description>Hello to all my dieheart fans (my mother). I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that I&amp;rsquo;m still alive for now (against many odds). Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath but its possible this blog could expand in the coming decades. For now I leave you with a baby llama I had the pleasure of meeting recently. An unpleasant creature that tried to attack me multiple times, and chased me out of the village.&#xA;king of las papas</description>
