comment: "Sorry for using your contact form but we had to be sure you got this. \r\n \r\nDid you suffer financially and/or were subjected to government mandates during the pandemic? Do you have W-2 employees? You very likely qualify for an Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. \r\n \r\nNo need to repay the funds and you can use them with no restrictions. \r\n \r\nIt only takes minutes and costs nothing to see if you qualify and get an estimate of your rebate. Simply visit: \r\n \r\nhttp://bit.ly/ertc-form"
