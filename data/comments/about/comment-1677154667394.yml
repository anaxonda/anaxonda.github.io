  Hi. I'm reaching out to see whether youâ€™ve applied for the covid-related
  Employee Retention Tax Credit? This credit is worth up to $26k per employee,
  and you *can* qualify for both this and PPP (the rules changed Nov 2021).  We
  can help you maximize this credit and have already done this for more than 250
  businesses. All our work is free until you receive a refund. Give us a call at
  888-479-6055 or email hello@refundspro.com for more info.
