comment: "Hello, \r\n \r\nWe provide funding through our venture capital company to both start-up and existing companies either looking for funding for expansion or to accelerate growth in their company. \r\nWe have a structured joint venture investment plan in which we are interested in an annual return on investment not more than 10% ROI. We are also currently structuring a convertible debt and loan financing of 3% interest repayable annually with no early repayment penalties. \r\n \r\nWe would like to review your business plan or executive summary to understand a much better idea of your business and what you are looking to do, this will assist in determining the best possible investment structure we can pursue and discuss more extensively. \r\n \r\n \r\nI hope to hear back from you soon. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\nSyed Atif \r\nInvestment Director \r\nDevcorp International E.C. \r\nP.O Box 10236 Shop No. 305 \r\nFlr 3 Manama Centre, Bahrain \r\nEmail: syedatif1001@gmail.com \r\nWebsite: https://devcorpinternational.com"
